# DRUG RESISTANCE

Drug resistance is a worldwide healthcare crisis that can lead to toxicities (Ahmadian et al., 2020). According to WHO definition, drug resistance is “the ability of microorganisms to withstand attack by antimicrobial drugs”, (Pasipanodya, and Gumbo, 2011), and this can lead to a reduction in the effectiveness/efficacy of a drug to cure a specific disease or improve the symptoms in a patient. Generally, Drug resistance can be developed against antibiotics, antivirals, or chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment (Chen, 2010). 

Drug resistance is a complex cellular response, which can be caused by different factors ranging from drug metabolism, drug activity at the target site, and the drug elimination phase (Gupta and Jhawat, 2017). Most importantly, Patients’ attitudes toward drug use can also be a contributing factor to the ones listed above. Drug resistance mechanism can either involve a target-specific or target-nonspecific mechanisms. (Chen T., 2010). In target-specific drug resistant mechanic, an alteration in a specific drug target that reduces/inhibits the interaction between the target and drug is the cause of drug resistance. For example, mutations in viral genes such as genetic shift/drift frequently lead to antiviral drug resistance while a loss of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) in breast cancer patients can lead to tamoxifen resistance. On the other hand, target-nonspecific drug resistance is resistance brought about by changes in parameters that are not directly relevant to or dependent on the drug target. For example, a drug target cell or organism might upreglate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) to degrade the drug or increase its efflux capacity, thereby resulting in decreased bioavailability and reduced drug effectiveness (Chen, 2010). 

Further more, Drug resistance has been observed to be one of the major causes of therapeutic problems that severely limit the outcome of different types of cancers such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer etc. Malignant cells rapidly develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents through various mechanisms also. This might include; reduced drug uptake due to OATP1B3 overexpression, increased drug efflux due to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression, triggering of DNA repair processes via ERCC1 upregulation, disruption of apoptotic signaling pathways due to Bcl-2 overexpression, and presence of cancer stem cells (Seth Kwabena Amponsah and Adams, 2022). 

One major aspect to consider in cancer management is the antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR), which is a major form of drug resistance. It is a very alarming situation in the management of cancer patients because of the concurrent microbial infections due to immunosuppression observed in patients taking chemotherapy. The microbial infections caused by these drug-resistant microbes usually lead to an increased risk of poorer clinical outcomes in cancer patients, including death among other economic and clinical issues. 

Understanding the genetic alterations at the cellular and microbial level that contributes to drug resistant will certainly help to improve the management and therapeutic outcomes in cancer patients.
